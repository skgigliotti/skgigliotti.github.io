<p> I am currently working as a Salesforce developer for the Westmont College Office of Advancement.
I write triggers and build custom components, working closely with the Advancement staff and other developers to
create a product that is functional on the front end and efficient behind the scenes. Check out my Github and
LinkedIn profiles to see more of my previous experience.</p>
